# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Description: This application is designed to pull the current weather data and a five day forecast for the city typed in the input. It gets the temperature humidity wind speed uv index of the city. This application only works for cities in the US.  A search button that puts the city into local storage and prints out back the city name. I wasn't able to get it to save mutlple cities in the search to be able to go back to the previous selections. Also the icon is not displayed.

You'll have to press the search button a couple of times to get output. I think this is happeneing because I'm calling the fucntions within eachother to get data from one function to another
